The Flexible Large-scale Agent Modelling Environment

Tutorial Example: Circles - point agents under elastic forces

(C) 2014 STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory

===================================================================

FLAME is a generic agent-based modelling system which can be used 
to development applications in many areas. It generates a complete 
agent-based application which can be compiled and built on the 
majority of computing systems ranging from laptops to super-computers.

The FLAME web site www.flame.ac.uk contains details on FLAME and the
projects in which it has been used.

===================================================================

NB: To make use of this FLAME example you will need to have installed
the complete FLAME system - xparser and libmboard.

Files included
==============

     circles.xml - the circles model
     functions.c - the state transitions functions
     its - results directory
				
Building  and Running the model
===============================

Build:
1. Install xparser and libmboard
2. Set FLAME_DIR environment variable to xparser installation directory
3. Edit Makefile.tmpl for libmboard install directory and compilers as necessary
4. Parser the model with xparser - xparser circles.xml
5. Build model - make. Should results is main executable plus a few others

Intial Data:
1. cd to its directory
2. Run init_start_state.py <w> <h> <n>: giving domain size and number of agents
3. Starting states files, 0.xml, created

Running:
1. Back to home directory
2. Type ./main for usage syntax - ./ main <num iters> <initial data>
3. Type ./main 10 its/0.xml - 10 iterations of output is in its
